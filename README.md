## What is passive mode?

A project can go into passive mode for either of two reasons. Either the project
is feature complete and no active development is needed. Or the project is no
longer considered a priority. Whatever the reason the end result is the same.

This means:

1. No more scheduled monthly releases.
2. If a bug is filed it is addressed on a best effort basis.
3. No new features are anticipated.
4. Releases are only cut on a needs basis and not more than once a month.
5. If you want your bug or feature to receive attention sponsoring is your best bet.
